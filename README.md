# Tombala Game
 A Tombala Game designed with Python and Qt Designer. In this project used Python's object oriented programming and Qt Designer's GUI features.
 
 First of all, an interface with an .ui extension is designed for the game to be written with Qt Designer. The designed interface has a menu and a game screen. These two screens are on the same Main Window as the design and one is hidden while the other is visible.
